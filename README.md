# IMDb does not have an API, for accessing information on movies and TV Series. Therefore we have to perform scraping for accessing information from the website.

Technologies Used: Python, BeautifulSoup, lxml

Designed an emotion-based movie recommendation system by scraping movie titles from IMDb
Performed Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup for accessing and pulling data out of HTML and XML files and used lxml for parsing the webpages

The correspondence of every emotion with genre of movies is listed below:

Sad – Drama
Disgust – Musical
Anger – Family
Anticipation – Thriller
Fear – Sport
Enjoyment – Thriller
Trust – Western
Surprise – Film-Noir

Based on the input emotion, the corresponding genre would be selected and all the top 5 movies of that genre would be recommended to the user.
